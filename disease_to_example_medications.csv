Bronchial Asthma,Inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) controller; ICS-formoterol as needed; short-acting beta-agonist (SABA) alternative,beclomethasone or budesonide (ICS); budesonide-formoterol (reliever/controller); salbutamol/albuterol (SABA),Prefer ICS-containing therapy; avoid SABA-only routine use unless no ICS available.
Hypertension,ACE inhibitor or ARB; calcium-channel blocker; thiazide-like diuretic,enalapril or lisinopril (ACEi); losartan or telmisartan (ARB); amlodipine (CCB); indapamide or chlorthalidone (thiazide-like),Choose per age/comorbidities; often start with single agent then combine.
Migraine,Acute: triptan; NSAID/acetaminophen. Preventive: beta-blocker; topiramate; tricyclic; CGRP mAb,"sumatriptan, rizatriptan; ibuprofen/naproxen/acetaminophen; propranolol; topiramate; amitriptyline; erenumab/fremanezumab",Match to frequency and contraindications; avoid triptans in vascular disease.
Cervical spondylosis,Analgesics; NSAIDs; topical NSAIDs; short-course muscle relaxant (selected cases),paracetamol (acetaminophen); ibuprofen/naproxen; diclofenac gel; short diazepam/cyclobenzaprine (only if advised),Emphasize physio/exercise and posture; meds are symptomatic and short term.
Jaundice,Not a single-disease treatment; requires evaluation,—,"Jaundice is a symptom; urgent evaluation to find cause (hepatitis, obstruction, hemolysis). Do not self-treat."
Malaria,Artemisinin-based combination therapy (uncomplicated); IV artesunate (severe),artemether–lumefantrine; dihydroartemisinin–piperaquine; IV artesunate,Choice depends on species and local resistance; test first where possible.
urinary tract infection,First-line for uncomplicated cystitis,nitrofurantoin; trimethoprim–sulfamethoxazole; fosfomycin,"Avoid fluoroquinolones if alternatives work; adjust for local resistance, kidney function, pregnancy."
allergy,(Assuming allergic rhinitis) intranasal corticosteroid; non-sedating oral antihistamine; intranasal antihistamine,fluticasone or budesonide nasal spray; cetirizine/loratadine; azelastine nasal spray,Add saline rinses; consider leukotriene antagonist only if coexisting asthma or poor control.
peptic ulcer disease,Eradicate H. pylori if positive; acid suppression,bismuth quadruple therapy (PPI + bismuth + tetracycline + metronidazole) for 14 days; PPI (omeprazole/pantoprazole),Confirm H. pylori and perform test-of-cure; avoid NSAIDs and smoking/alcohol excess.
diabetes,Type 2: metformin first-line; add SGLT2 inhibitor or GLP-1 RA if ASCVD/CKD/HF,metformin; empagliflozin/dapagliflozin (SGLT2); semaglutide/liraglutide (GLP-1 RA),Individualize; monitor renal function; hypoglycemia risk with sulfonylureas/insulin.
drug reaction,Immediate actions and symptomatic treatment,stop offending drug; oral antihistamine (cetirizine); topical corticosteroid; anaphylaxis: intramuscular epinephrine,"Severe reactions (SJS/TEN, DRESS, anaphylaxis) are emergencies—hospital care."
gastroesophageal reflux disease,Acid suppression; alginate/antacid,proton pump inhibitor (omeprazole/pantoprazole); H2 blocker (famotidine); alginate+antacid,Trial once-daily PPI 8 weeks; step down to lowest effective dose.
allergyallergy,Duplicate of allergy,—,Same as 'allergy' row; consider de-duplication in your dataset.
Acne,"Topical benzoyl peroxide; topical retinoid; topical/oral antibiotics (limited, combined with BPO)","benzoyl peroxide; adapalene/tretinoin; clindamycin (topical, with BPO); doxycycline (moderate–severe)",Avoid oral antibiotics as monotherapy or long durations; consider hormonal therapy in females.
Arthritis,(General) topical/oral NSAIDs; acetaminophen; intra-articular steroid (OA flares). RA requires DMARDs,ibuprofen/naproxen/diclofenac gel; paracetamol; short-course intra-articular triamcinolone; (RA: methotrexate under specialist),Specify subtype (OA vs RA) for precise therapy; use lowest effective NSAID dose.
Pneumonia,Outpatient adults without comorbidities: amoxicillin or doxycycline; consider macrolide where resistance low,amoxicillin; doxycycline; azithromycin (region-dependent),"Use local guidelines, severity scores, and atypical coverage as indicated."
Dimorphic Hemorrhoids,Symptom relief; stool-bulking; topical agents,fiber/psyllium; stool softener (docusate); short-course topical lidocaine or hydrocortisone; flavonoids (where used),Address constipation; consider rubber-band ligation/surgery for persistent or severe disease.
Common Cold,Symptomatic only; no antibiotics,acetaminophen; decongestant; antihistamine (first-gen) + decongestant combo; cough suppressants (dextromethorphan),Usually self-limited 7–10 days; test for flu/COVID if indicated.
Chicken pox,Antiviral for selected groups; symptomatic care,"acyclovir (adults, severe, immunocompromised); acetaminophen for fever",Start antivirals early when indicated; avoid aspirin in children (Reye's risk).
Dengue,Supportive care; analgesic/antipyretic,acetaminophen (paracetamol); oral/IV fluids as per protocol,Avoid NSAIDs/aspirin due to bleeding risk; watch for warning signs.
Fungal infection,Topical antifungals for limited tinea; oral for extensive/refractory,"terbinafine cream; clotrimazole/miconazole; oral terbinafine or itraconazole (if extensive, clinician-directed)",Confirm diagnosis; treat 1–2 weeks beyond clinical clearance.
Typhoid,Antibiotics guided by local resistance,azithromycin; ceftriaxone or cefixime; (fluoroquinolones often resistant in South Asia),"Test and follow local antibiogram; consider complications; vaccines are for prevention, not treatment."
Varicose Veins,Non-drug mainstay; venoactive agents optional,graduated compression stockings; micronized purified flavonoid fraction (where used),"Definitive therapy is procedural (ablation, sclerotherapy, surgery) rather than tablets."
